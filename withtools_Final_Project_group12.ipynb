    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "You need to calculate revenue of a company from 4 years (2019, 2020, 2021, 2022) and calculate the average. You find the revenue for 2019, 2020, 2021, but the documents do not include revenue for 2022.\n",
    "You should look if you have a tool to calculate the revenue. Use the tool calculate_revenue to find the revenue of 2022. For this you need to extract the necessary data from the document another time.\n",
    "In this case you need to find the sales and average price or sales price. Extract another set of documents including those data and then calculate the revenue based on what data you are able to retrieve.\n",
    "For example, you need to calculate average revenue and compare it with some other parameter. From the retrieved documents you were able to find all the necessary values for the calculation except for the revenue in the year 2022. So you need to look if you have a tool to calculate the revenue a figure what variables you need to calculate it. Then retrieve the documents that include those values necessary for the calculation and calculate the missing value.\n",
    "For example, if the data include average price and not sales price, calculate the revenue like sales * average price.\n",
    "This means you not have the revenue for 2022 and you can calculate the average revenue for all the 4 years and continue with the query. \n",
    "You should first attempt to calculate the individual values you need for the final calculation and then move to the final calculation. Meaning if you have to calculate revenue from certain year and then compare it with some other parameter, you should first calculate the average revenue from all those year and then use this calculated value of average revenue to calculate the final query with the other parameter.\n",
    "Focus on the calculation. If you miss any value, do not continue with a unknown variable. You should attempt to calculate it and continue with the numerical value, if the query requires a numerical answer.\n",
