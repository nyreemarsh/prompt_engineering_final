To find the total value of these securities, we multiply the number of securities by the weighted-average exercise price: \n\nTotal Value = Number of Securities × Weighted-Average Exercise Price  \nTotal Value = 766,801 × $40.85 = $31,305,000.85, which rounds to approximately $31.31 million.\n\nHowever, the question specifically asks for the total value of securities approved by security holders but not yet issued, which is represented by the number of securities remaining available for future issuance under equity compensation plans (excluding those reflected in column (a)). This value is 8,945,694, which is the number of securities remaining available for future issuance. \n\nThus, the total value of securities approved by security holders but not yet issued is calculated as follows:\n\nTotal Value = Number of Securities Remaining Available × Weighted-Average Exercise Price  \nTotal Value = 8,945,694 × $40.85 = $364,000,000.90, which rounds to approximately $364 million.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is $364 million.",
